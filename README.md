# C Datastructures and Algorithms
This is an implementation of all the datastructures and algorithms that I can think of or I am currently learning. This is a side project, so it is always in development. I plan on making this an official library at some point, but until then,
it is a toy personal project.

If you want to use this library you can, I don't have a license but it is free to use.
